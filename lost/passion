  <h1>Wandering Lost</h1>
<p1>I believe there is an art to being lost. It's beautiful
  to me to wander aimlessly sometimes. Getting lost doesn't
  have to be in the real world it can be anywhere. I can get
  lost through google searches, video games, going for a walk,
  creating a new project, etc. I think I most enjoy the exploration
  of it all because becoming lost opens up doors.</p1>
