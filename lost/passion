  <h1>WANDERING LOST</h1>
<p1>I believe there is an <strong>art to being <em>lost.</em></strong> It's beautiful
  to me to <em>wander aimlessly</em> sometimes. Getting lost doesn't
  have to be in the real world it can be <strong>anywhere.</strong> I can get
  lost through google searches, video games, going for a walk,
  creating a new project, etc. I think I most enjoy the exploration
  of it all because becoming lost <strong>opens up doors.</strong></p1>

  <h2>CHILDHOOD STORIES</h2>

<p2>There's something fantastic about getting lost.
  In fairytales the main character will often get
  hopelessly lost. They usually learn a new lesson.
  These stories have the character interact with monsters,
  princesses, wizards, etc. When I get lost I feel like
  one of these characters I idolized as a child. There's
  something whimisical about getting lost. Now I wander around
  craft stores, park trails, neighborhood streets, and anywhere
  that interests me.</p2>
