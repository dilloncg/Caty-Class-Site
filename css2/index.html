  <p>CNBC contacted both Kardashian via one of her
    companies and Ethereum Max for comment but had
    not received any response at the time of writing.
    Randell acknowledged that Kardashian had flagged
    that the post was an ad, in line with
    Instagram’s rules. “But she didn’t have to
    disclose that Ethereum Max — not to be confused
    with Ethereum — was a <span class="green">speculative</span> digital token
    created a month before by unknown
    developers — one of hundreds of such tokens
    that fill the crypto-exchanges,” Randell said
    at the Cambridge International Symposium on
    Economic Crime. Randell said that while he
    couldn’t say if Ethereum Max specifically was
    a scam, he pointed out that “social media
    influencers are routinely paid by scammers
    to help them pump and dump new tokens on the
    back of pure speculation.” He added that some
    influencers had promoted tokens that turned
    out to not even exist. </p>
